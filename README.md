# Jetbrains Overflow ([rainglow](https://rainglow.io/)) Darker Colour Scheme

Modified version of the Overflow rianglow theme to suit my IDE

## Installation

Open up Preferences/Settings and navigate to `Editor -> Color Scheme`, to the right of the scheme dropdown click the three vertical dots and choose `Import Scheme...` selecting the file downloaded from this repository.

The theme should then be available to choose as `Overflow Rainglow Darker (clnt)`, select and hit apply.
